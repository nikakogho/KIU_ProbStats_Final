KIU probability and statistics final project

We will test whether Falcon 9 booster reuse changes first-stage landing success probability (new vs reused), using MLE + two-proportion inference analytically, validate via simulation, and confirm on real r/SpaceX API data with clear plots and logistic regression controlling for payload mass and time.
